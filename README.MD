# Google Voice Chrome Extension Redesign

Redesigned Google Voice extension to take on material design principles as well as the new Google Voice logo, coloring, and styling.

This project was just for fun and my own use. CSS is a ton of fun and it was a personal experiment for me to unpack and modify a Chrome extension.

Note: this is a work in progress and I didn't go into a lot of detail so the code is very messy and not characteristic of my typical work. It was rough and dirty coding just for my own amusement.

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the files from this repository to your computer and save them somewhere safe.
2. Open Chrome and head to chrome://extensions
3. Enable the developer mode switch.
4. Click "Load unpacked extension.

Note: the code is all available here for review, and I don't receive your credentials or information. Just like the Official extension, you must sign into Google on the website to use this. No special app authorization is required, and I haven't changed any of the core functionality of the app, only the visual styles  (HTML, CSS, and the addition of [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons).

## Credit

### [Google](https://google.com) and the [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) team.
This is just a lot of restyling of the extension they created. I'm a major Google fanboy and dye-hard user of all things Google (in fact, I've used Google Voice as my only phone number since 2009!).
